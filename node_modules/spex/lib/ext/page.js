/**
 * @method page
 * @summary Resolves a dynamic sequence of pages/arrays with $[mixed values].
 * @description
 * **Alternative Syntax:**
 * `page(source, {dest, limit})` &#8658; `Promise`
 *
 * Acquires pages (arrays of $[mixed values]) from the source function, one by one,
 * and resolves each page as a $[batch], till no more pages left or an error/reject occurs.
 *
 * <img src="../images/page.png" width="561px" height="193px" alt="page">
 *
 * @param {Function|generator} source
 * Expected to return a $[mixed value] that resolves with the next page of data (array of $[mixed values]).
 * Returning or resolving with `undefined` ends the sequence, and the method resolves.
 *
 * The function is called with the same `this` context as the calling method.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - `index` = index of the page being requested
 *  - `data` = previously returned page, resolved as a $[batch] (`undefined` when `index=0`)
 *  - `delay` = number of milliseconds since the last call (`undefined` when `index=0`)
 *
 * If the function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the method rejects with
 * object `{index, error, source}`:
 *  - `index` = index of the request that failed
 *  - `error` = the error thrown or the rejection reason
 *  - `source` = resolved `data` that was passed into the function
 *
 * And if the function returns or resolves with anything other than an array or `undefined`,
 * the method rejects with the same object, but with `error` set to `Unexpected data returned
 * from the source.`
 *
 * Passing in anything other than a function will throw `Invalid page source.`
 *
 * @param {Function|generator} [dest]
 * Optional destination function (or generator), to receive a resolved $[batch] of data
 * for each page, process it and respond as required.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - `index` = page index in the sequence
 *  - `data` = page data resolved as a $[batch]
 *  - `delay` = number of milliseconds since the last call (`undefined` when `index=0`)
 *
 * The function is called with the same `this` context as the calling method.
 *
 * It can optionally return a promise object, if notifications are handled asynchronously.
 * And if a promise is returned, the method will not request another page from the `source`
 * function until the promise has been resolved.
 *
 * If the function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the sequence terminates,
 * and the method rejects with object `{index, error, dest}`:
 * - `index` = index of the page passed into the function
 * - `error` = the error thrown or the rejection reason
 * - `dest` = resolved $[batch] that was passed into the function
 *
 * @param {Number} [limit=0]
 * Limits the maximum number of pages to be requested from the `source`. If the value is greater
 * than 0, the method will successfully resolve once the specified limit has been reached.
 *
 * When `limit` isn't specified (default), the sequence is unlimited, and it will continue
 * till one of the following occurs:
 *  - `source` returns or resolves with `undefined` or an invalid value (non-array)
 *  - either `source` or `dest` functions throw an error or return a rejected promise
 *
 * @returns {Promise}
 * When successful, the method resolves with object `{pages, total, duration}`:
 *  - `pages` = number of pages resolved
 *  - `total` = the sum of all page sizes (total number of values resolved)
 *  - `duration` = number of milliseconds consumed by the method
 *
 * When the method fails, there are two types of rejects that may occur:
 *  - *Normal Reject*: when one of the pages failed to resolve as a $[batch]
 *  - *Internal Reject*: caused by either the `source` or the `dest` functions
 *
 * *Normal Rejects* are reported with object `{index, data}`:
 *  - `index` = index of the page rejected by method $[batch]
 *  - `data` = the rejection data from method $[batch]
 *
 * *Internal Rejects* are reported with object `{index, error, [source], [dest]}`:
 *  - `index` = index of the page for which the error/reject occurred
 *  - `error` = the error thrown or the rejection reason
 *  - `source` - set when caused by the `source` function (see `source` parameter)
 *  - `dest` - set when caused by the `dest` function (see `dest` parameter)
 *
 * Object for both reject types has method `getError()` to simplify access to the error.
 * For *Normal Rejects* it will return `data.first` (see method $[batch]),
 * and `error` value for the *Internal Rejects*.
